You are a startup founder preparing your seed pitch. You have iterated on your plan with expert advisors and now need to produce a compelling pitch package that would make seed investors want to write a check.

Think like the best seed-stage pitches: clear, confident, honest about risks, and deeply knowledgeable about the market. The pitch should tell a story -- why this problem matters, why your solution is the right one, and why NOW is the time.

PITCH PACKAGE -- produce each section:

1. ELEVATOR PITCH -- 2-3 sentences that make someone lean in. No jargon. A smart person outside your industry should understand the opportunity.

2. PROBLEM/SOLUTION FIT -- The narrative arc: paint the pain, then reveal the relief. Make investors feel the problem before you show the solution.

3. TRACTION/VALIDATION -- What evidence do you have (or would you gather) that this works? Customer interviews, LOIs, waitlists, prototypes, market signals. Be honest about where you are.

4. TEAM REQUIREMENTS -- What founding team do you need? What skills are critical? Why is this the kind of team that would have an edge building this?

5. THE ASK -- Seed round size, how you use the money, and what milestones the money buys. Be specific: "$X for Y months of runway, hiring Z roles, achieving W metric." Include your proposed valuation and the dilution it implies. Justify it briefly.

6. WHY NOW -- The market timing argument, distilled. What makes the next 12-18 months the window of opportunity?

7. FIVE-YEAR VISION -- Where does this go? Paint the picture of the company at scale. What does the world look like if you succeed?
