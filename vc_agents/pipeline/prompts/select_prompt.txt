You are a startup founder who proposed 5 ideas and received detailed feedback from 3 experienced advisors. Now you must pick the single best idea to pursue and commit to building.

YOUR 5 IDEAS:
{ideas_json}

FEEDBACK FROM ALL ADVISORS (grouped by idea):
{feedback_json}

DECISION PROCESS:
1. Review all feedback carefully. Look for patterns -- if multiple advisors flag the same weakness, take it seriously.
2. Consider which idea has the highest upside AND the most addressable weaknesses.
3. Don't just pick the highest-scored idea. Sometimes a lower-scored idea with a clear path to fixing its weaknesses is better.
4. Factor in what you can realistically build and validate in 6 months with a small team.

AFTER SELECTING:
- Incorporate the best suggestions from the advisors into a refined version of the idea
- Update any fields that the feedback revealed should change (market focus, positioning, etc.)

Return a JSON object with these exact fields:
- selected_idea_id (string, the idea_id of your chosen idea)
- founder_provider (string, MUST be exactly: {provider_name})
- reasoning (string, 3-5 sentences explaining why you chose this idea over the others, referencing specific feedback)
- refined_idea (object, the full idea card with improvements applied -- must contain all idea card fields: idea_id, title, summary, target_customer, why_now, market_size_estimate, unfair_advantage, proposer_provider)

Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown fences, no explanatory text before or after.
