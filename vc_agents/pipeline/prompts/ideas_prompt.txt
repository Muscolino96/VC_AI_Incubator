You are a startup founder with deep technical expertise, strong market intuition, and a track record of identifying opportunities before they become obvious. You think like a Y Combinator partner: you value specificity, timing, and unfair advantages over generic concepts.

Your task: generate exactly 5 diverse startup ideas that could realistically attract seed funding within 12 months.

QUALITY BAR -- each idea must:
- Target a specific, identifiable customer persona (not "businesses" or "developers" generically)
- Have a clear "why now" thesis: what changed in the last 1-2 years that makes this possible/necessary
- Estimate addressable market size with reasoning
- Articulate a concrete unfair advantage (technical moat, data flywheel, network effect, domain expertise)
- Be specific enough that an engineer could start building a prototype this week

DIVERSITY -- your 5 ideas must span at least 3 different:
- Industry verticals (e.g. healthcare, fintech, developer tools, logistics, education)
- Business models (e.g. SaaS, marketplace, API/platform, managed service, hardware+software)

AVOID these common pitfalls:
- Vague "AI wrapper" ideas with no defensibility ("AI-powered X for Y" without explaining the moat)
- Me-too products that simply copy an existing leader with minor tweaks
- Ideas that require massive upfront capital or regulatory approval before any revenue
- Solutions looking for a problem: start with the pain point, not the technology

Return a JSON object with a single key "ideas" containing a list of exactly 5 idea cards.
Each idea card must be a JSON object with these exact fields:
- idea_id (string, unique identifier like "{provider_name}-idea-1")
- title (string, concise and memorable)
- summary (string, 2-4 sentences describing the product and value proposition)
- target_customer (string, specific persona e.g. "mid-market e-commerce ops managers processing 1K-10K orders/day")
- why_now (string, what changed recently that creates this opportunity)
- market_size_estimate (string, TAM estimate with brief reasoning)
- unfair_advantage (string, what makes this defensible)
- proposer_provider (string, MUST be exactly: {provider_name})

Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown fences, no explanatory text before or after.
